	<description>Changes RimWorld to have more repeatable RNG.

[h2]What does this do?[/h2]
By default, RimWorld rarely resets the random number generator. Therefore, loading the same save repeatedly will result in different events each time, without user input. This mod resets the random number generator at the start of every tick, meaning the same starting point for the same tick will always result in the same output.
I made this mod as there's a larger project I'm going to work on that requires RimWorld to have consistent RNG. Other modders might find use in this, and maybe some players wanna see how it changes loading a save.

As a player, this mod might not be terribly useful. If you do nothing after loading a save, the same results will always play out. But once you change anything, that can't be guaranteed.
How much your actions will change the outcome of RNG is unknown - I think that some events, like when a raid happens, should be much more consistent. But, that isn't the goal of this mod.

[h2]How does this work?[/h2]
At the start of every tick (TickManager.DoSingleTick), RimWorld's random number generator (Verse.Rand) is given a new seed (Rand.PushState).
This seed is determined by the world seed (World.info.seedString), plus the current tick (TickManager.TicksGame)</description>
